# Randoms

* This contains my random work (mostly HTML,CSS and JavaScript), that I do in free time to learn something.
* This is for my personal use, but if anyone find anything intresting in it, they can have it.
 
## 1. Random Colors Generator
Created by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. This generate random background colors for a web page, and also provide the hex value of the color.
 
## 2. Random Gradient Generator
Similar to the previous one, this one will generate a random gradient background instead of a single color. This also gives you the hex values of colors that are generated to make the Gradient.
